Introduction
  Overview
  Getting started with Idris

Core Idris
  Interactive Development with Types
  User-defined data types
  Interactive Programs: input and output processing
  Programming with first-class types
  Interfaces: using constrained generic types
  Equality: expressing relationships between data
  Predicates: expressing assumptions and contracts in types
  Views: extending pattern matching

Idris and the Real World
  Streams and processes: working with infinite data
  Writing programs with state
  State machines: verifying protocols in types
  Dependent state machines: handling feedback and errors
  Type-safe concurrent programming
